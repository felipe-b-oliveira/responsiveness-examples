# Responsiveness Examples
A respository with some examples of CSS responsiveness

* Using flexible layout we can divide the page elements by components like frontend frameworks like React/Vue.js.
* In the css the page elements are divided by individual components and the styles are applied individually.
* For this we use the css math functions like “min()”, “max()”, and “clamp()”.
